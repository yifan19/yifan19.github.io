		<p> <em>to the future Unilock chad and RW </em> </p>

		<p> 1B electrical has been a challenge to me.
		I never studied this hard in my life. I realized that
		I found something I at least enjoy doing. 
		</p>
		

		<p>
		Midterm week was harsh for me since we did not have a reading week to prepare,
		but that wasn't really a big problem.  I have also gotten my first rejection. <br>

		I knew she was going to say no, but I needed an direct answer. I don't regret anything,
		I might have broken our relationship as friends, but it is better than staying together not on the same page.

		Apart from that, midterms went decently well and I am surving my overloaded 1B. ! Psychology !

		<br>

		Going back home for reading week felt amazing, I get to relax and do things I enjoy after doing so many problems and
		giving my 100% to the midterms. 

		It felt relaxing and I thought I got over the rejection I got on the Monday (Cal midterm).

		

		<br>

		Fast foward a week in...
		Of course not, after the main round ended I received 3 not ranked from all tech/software companies and only got a merely ranked
		for Unilock. Only 2 people actually interviewed for this job, so my self-esteem enjoyed the trip in the gutter.

		<br> 
		
		Indeed, the interview for YUJA, a better version of UWLearn (not exactly but close enough), went very well. I thought I could at least secure a rank.

		At that point, I had more trouble sleeping than 3 weeks ago when the girl I liked coldly walked away from me.

		I realized that we learn more from rejections than lectures and tutorials.
		Students in other universities will never experience this amount of stress and rejection in their first year. I guess that's what separates UW to other universities.

		Nevertheless, I got my match 3 days after on the following Monday. <strong> I am glad to announce that I will be working for Unilock during this summer </strong>

		<br>

		I have also learned about <strong> Jia Jiang </strong>. He inspired me to dig in to my fear of rejection. I would ask people stuff that I would never ask, looking for a rejection.
		I wanted to feel the heart-rate going up so I get used to be more out-going. I guess Rejection Therapy will make you immune to other people's rejection and keep your self-esteem protected
		from what other people's opinions.

		<br>

		Only 3 weeks left before finals hit, I hope I'll survive 1B better the same way I did for 1A. I am glad I got everything sorted out, such as renting my UW apartment and getting a place in Georgetown.

		<br>
		I really want to wish RW the best of luck in her job hunt and don't be creeped out when I smile at you. I know it is over.

  <h2> March 18, 2018 </h2>

   <p>
      Last friday, spent bunch of time during VHDL in the ecelab, almost killed myself over the bugs I had. Glad I could finish yesterday but I ended upkilling my St-Patrick's.
      Ya saw bunch of people partying while I was working on Math119 and ECE124. I at least I get some pleasure finishing the project on time.

    

      <br>

      Overall a lot of stress since finals are coming up, but definitely worth it. This has been my best year so far. I learned so much. Especially how to deal with rejection and failure. 
      <br>
      
      Hopefully I will hear back from Unilock, because my rommates all signed their contract and I still haven't heard from anyone from Unilock so far.

      I really hope the job is not boring since I avoided QA for that reason.
      Anyways I should be grateful that they accepted me, a first year with no experience.
