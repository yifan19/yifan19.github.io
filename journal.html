		<p> <em>to the future Unilock chad and RW </em> </p>

		<p> 1B electrical has been a challenge to me.
		I never studied this hard in my life. I realized that
		I found something I at least enjoy doing. 
		</p>
		

		<p>
		Midterm week was harsh for me since we did not have a reading week to prepare,
		but that wasn't really a big problem.  I have also gotten my first rejection. <br>

		I knew she was going to say no, but I needed an direct answer. I don't regret anything,
		I might have broken our relationship as friends, but it is better than staying together not on the same page.

		Apart from that, midterms went decently well and I am surving my overloaded 1B. ! Psychology !

		<br>

		Going back home for reading week felt amazing, I get to relax and do things I enjoy after doing so many problems and
		giving my 100% to the midterms. 

		It felt relaxing and I thought I got over the rejection I got on the Monday (Cal midterm).

		

		<br>

		Fast foward a week in...
		Of course not, after the main round ended I received 3 not ranked from all tech/software companies and only got a merely ranked
		for Unilock. Only 2 people actually interviewed for this job, so my self-esteem enjoyed the trip in the gutter.

		<br> 
		
		Indeed, the interview for YUJA, a better version of UWLearn (not exactly but close enough), went very well. I thought I could at least secure a rank.

		At that point, I had more trouble sleeping than 3 weeks ago when the girl I liked coldly walked away from me.

		I realized that we learn more from rejections than lectures and tutorials.
		Students in other universities will never experience this amount of stress and rejection in their first year. I guess that's what separates UW to other universities.

		Nevertheless, I got my match 3 days after on the following Monday. <strong> I am glad to announce that I will be working for Unilock during this summer </strong>

		<br>

		I have also learned about <strong> Jia Jiang </strong>. He inspired me to dig in to my fear of rejection. I would ask people stuff that I would never ask, looking for a rejection.
		I wanted to feel the heart-rate going up so I get used to be more out-going. I guess Rejection Therapy will make you immune to other people's rejection and keep your self-esteem protected
		from what other people's opinions.

		<br>

		Only 3 weeks left before finals hit, I hope I'll survive 1B better the same way I did for 1A. I am glad I got everything sorted out, such as renting my UW apartment and getting a place in Georgetown.

		<br>
		I really want to wish RW the best of luck in her job hunt and don't be creeped out when I smile at you. I know it is over.

  <h2> March 18, 2018 </h2>

   <p>
      Last friday, spent bunch of time during VHDL in the ecelab, almost killed myself over the bugs I had. Glad I could finish yesterday but I ended upkilling my St-Patrick's.
      Ya saw bunch of people partying while I was working on Math119 and ECE124. I at least I get some pleasure finishing the project on time.

    

      <br>

      Overall a lot of stress since finals are coming up, but definitely worth it. This has been my best year so far. I learned so much. Especially how to deal with rejection and failure. 
      <br>
      
      Hopefully I will hear back from Unilock, because my rommates all signed their contract and I still haven't heard from anyone from Unilock so far.

      I really hope the job is not boring since I avoided QA for that reason.
      Anyways I should be grateful that they accepted me, a first year with no experience.

     
   </p>

  <h2> March 25, 2018 </h2>

  <p> Did not go to grading today, definitely not prepared. YuJia said
  he wanted to start his own company by securing the name first. I'm down,
  but I also want to help Weijie or even Jiming and Zhongyu out.
  </p>
  <p> Anyways, Jiu-Jitsu was cancelled today so I went to the gym. My arms
  really hurt right now. I am also very hungry, so I'll grab some food and
  start ECE108 as2 in latex.
  </p>

  <p> wish me luck </p>

  <h2> March 28, 2018 </h2>
  <p> <em> to the github stalker </em> </p>
  <p> just finished editing the lab report, I don't know why RW
  absolutely wants to write the report. It was weird in a sense that she
  didn't want to participate in the lab. This lab was definitely one of 
  the most awkward lab we had so far. Even the lab instructor Frank was giving her a bad time. Oh well! It is over now! 
  </p>

  <p> apart from that, I need to finish Ward's assignment 2 soon so I can get back to studying for finals. I am really behind on 140 assignments and also 124. Hopefully I will catch up by the finals, but I really doubt it.
  </p>

  <p> I have a friday off this week, I can definitely use that to study a little bit more and probably finish off 108. Speaking of 108, we did graph theory in less than 2 hours. Well, Prof Ward's lectures are always <strong> fking entertaining</strong>, even though he argueably can't teach. 
  </p>
  <p> I called in CECA to ask if a contract was necessary for my position and she told me it is not a requirement. It is a bit sketchy but I definitely understand her point of view. Anyways, life in university is really demanding and I wish I could have more free time to do more side projects and thingsthat are not strictly academic.

  <p> <em> to the person maybe finishing 1B </em> </p>

  <p> Today is Easter friday. We have the day off to relax. I really hope I will be productive and finish up 108 as2 since i really don't want to work on it on the weekend
      Anyways, 2 days ago, I asked RW if I could join them on their Niagara trip. I was surprised she didn't say no rightaway. I guess Jia was definitely right. 
    <br>
  We would be very surprised how easy people will accept your request, provided you ask them.</p>
  <p> Anyways, finals in a week of time, I shouldn't care about my grades anymore. Prof Saini was right yesterday when I showed up to his office hours. It is really
  about how much you learn than how high your grades are. Reaching for that #1 spot is useless and you will break yourself doing so

	<h2> April 1st 2018 </h2>
  <p> <em> to the person making tons of mistake</em> </p>

  <p> So yesterday was a hell of fun writing my 108 assignment in LaTeX. I especially enjoyed the K-map package with all the flying colors.
    <br>
  so I went in to Bilun's room to grab his bowl that he forgot to bring down. That completely triggered him. He was unusually upset for something that could be settled in a more calm manner</p>
  <p>
  I guess it something that he really dislikes, I should be very careful next time and ask for permission 
  </p> 
  <p>
  I am going to get sushi for lunch with all my roommates, Daniel and Tingwei if he decides to wake up at a reasonable time. 
  <br>
  I kind of relaxed this morning, didn't feel like doing any problems and studying for anything.
  <br>
  instead I decided to chill and install another version of linux on my old pc. It felt like Ubuntu 64x was a bit tough and constantly will lag the poor machine
  <br>
  Also, the chinese friends posted bunch of photos of them going to Niagara. Looked like they enjoyed themselves. I am kind of jealous since I stayed home all day doing "work". But a rejection opens the door to other opportunities. I went to Mel's with other ECE friends (shiv Ilya and Kate). It was fun
  </p> 
  <p>
  anyways I also want to know if this distro runs atom better since I could not open Atom on 64 bit Ubuntu.
  <br>
  Finals in exactly 7 1/2 days from now. It is going to be a long week of studying. I'll keep my journal up to date, see you soon.

  <p> <em>to the person that typed 28 pages of LaTeX</em> </p>
  <p> I am not math student unfortunately, but I still enjoy the shit out of LaTex. The thing is so powerful it is amazing </p>
  <p> just finished the 108 as1 this morning, will be working on as3 tomorrow </p>
  <p> 1 week left before MATH119, I need to start studying, I won't be doing the lab 4 extra project because I don't have the time for that
  <br>
  other than that, I think I need more practice with 124, but I am super lazy to study because state machines are super long to do. I haven't done a single state reduction on my own and I can't draw a flow chart.
  </p>
  <p> I enjoyed my long week-end, food was really good yesterday. Reddit is correct </p>
  <p> That's it for now, I have Saini's help session to attend this morning. Enough with fidgeting with CSS </p>

  <h2> April 04 2018 </h2>
  <p>
  Just saw my assignment 1 grades, it went decently well, although people such as Daniel and Aditya are still upset...<br>
  First thing that Jason asked was how high is the average...
  <br>
  Why do you give a shit? <br>
  Why? Why am I not upset that I didn't get the 100% I wanted?

  </p>
  <p>
    well, because grades are just numbers, if you think they should reflect on how hard you worked on the assignment, you are only partially correct, only very partially
    <br>
    I think that you should evaluate yourself on how much you learned spending a decent chunk of your time doing this assignment. Personnally, I gained knowledge of VIM, LaTeX and set theory. Everything is a learning opportunity, expecting an external award will make you disappointed. I had a lot of fun learning these new tools and a 87 is very good. 
  <p>
    In psychology, this is the difference between an extrinsic and intrinsic reward. People that think they deserve a 90+ for their work in order for them to justify spending a shit ton of time on an assignment is trying to validate their effort with with an extrinsic reward, grades. Prof Saini is correct,
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> We are here for the knowledge and 
         we are here to learn how to learn </em>
    <br>
    <strong> No one will give a shit about your grades </strong>
    <br>
    don't make your grade define you
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  people in ECE need to change their mentality, that includes myself. Hopefully more and more people will start caring about what they are learning in class and not about the exams that are just there to verify if you have learnt the material.

  <p> Totally too lazy to write anything, really should get studying.</p>
  <p> oh, I got my picture with all the profs, except Kennings
    <br> I really enjoyed my 1B term, especially 108 with Ward. 
    <br> Unfortunately, this opinion is not very popular, as people really hate his teaching style and classes. I really enjoy it so...
    <br> I am indeed a pretty weird person.

  <h2> April 8 2018 </h2>
  <p> <em> To the person that will never be a frosh again </em> </p>
  <p> I am writing this at 9 54, waiting for ZW to finish his long ass shower. I am super sleepy so I need to make this concise. </p>
  <p> I went to the gym today... It really hurts your body, but it does release stress and make your body tired so you don't think of anything too stressful </p>
  <p> I stopped trying to get rejected by people the past week so I am really shy. I saw a classmate in V1 today and I simply said a Hi. I also wanted to do squats using the squat rack, but I was too shy to ask.
  </p>

  <p> hopefully I will get back to where I was weeks ago. Weijie bought masterclass. It would be interesting if I also could learn from that website since I'll be pretty much free during my summer time.

  <p> <strong> 1 Down, 5 to go </strong> this is what S.Page would say if I was still attending his lectures in Marianopolis. </p>
  <p> I am done with calculus today... I realized I made one silly mistake,
  but I am proud of myself. I think I understand all the material of the course. Hopefully I won't forget them as fast as I learned them. </p>
  <p> I am worried of not finishing my reading in time. I want to finish studying for psychology before tomorrow afternoon so I can study more circuits(ECE140</p>
  <p> We will see how well I do tomorrow, but I still have to finish 2 chapters of reading material </p>
  <p> I ordered a drawing tablet and cialdini's book on influence. I plan to do a lot of reading in the next weeks or so.

  <h2> April 122 2018 </h2>
  <p> <em> to knowledge and the person who thinks exams are fun</em> </p>
  <p> <strong> 3 Down, 3 to go </strong> We are getting close to finishing everything and go back and relax in Montreal! </p>
  <p> 4 hours ago, I finished my 140 Final. Just yesterday, I actually bought the textbook. It occured to me that I care enough for the course that I want to read it over the summer. Anyways, it is a required textbook for 240. The next-level circuit next year. Not saying that I will study that hard, but I felt like buying the textbook because I realized how ironic the situation is.</p>
  <p>
  indeed, we had to pay 10K per semester for everything and we can't even pay for a well-written textbook... Prof. Dabbagh is right on the fact that people don't read as much as we used to. We are a lot more on laptops and cell phones. I still find it funny that he is saying that we are living in a microwave. He is right on that since all the cell towers emit high frequency signal that damages our brains and is slowly cooking us.
  </p>
  </p>
  Anyways, I realized also that I am more prompt to commit on my studying if a buy a textbook since I will care about it far more than if I got it off online as a pdf. I actually want to get my money back in terms of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p> Also I realized we only have a week left before we start packing up for Montreal. Time flies so fast here. Really, I feel like I only spent a couple of weeks here in CLV. Hopefully my summer coop will be enjoyable. I don't really care about the pay as long as I enjoy the job and have a good time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Oh well, We'll see what is going to happen with my finals and hopefully I'll get to go to karate tonight. It has been at least 2 months before the last time I showed up. Time is precious here in Waterloo, I feel a lot of people don't care as much.
