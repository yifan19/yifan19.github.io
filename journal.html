		<p class = "dedicatedTo"> <em>to the future Unilock chad and RW </em> </p>

		<p> 1B electrical has been a challenge to me.
		I never studied this hard in my life. I realized that
		I found something I at least enjoy doing. 
		</p>
		

		<p>
		Midterm week was harsh for me since we did not have a reading week to prepare,
		but that wasn't really a big problem.  I have also gotten my first rejection. <br>

		I knew she was going to say no, but I needed an direct answer. I don't regret anything,
		I might have broken our relationship as friends, but it is better than staying together not on the same page.

		Apart from that, midterms went decently well and I am surving my overloaded 1B. ! Psychology !

		<br>

		Going back home for reading week felt amazing, I get to relax and do things I enjoy after doing so many problems and
		giving my 100% to the midterms. 

		It felt relaxing and I thought I got over the rejection I got on the Monday (Cal midterm).

		

		<br>

		Fast foward a week in...
		Of course not, after the main round ended I received 3 not ranked from all tech/software companies and only got a merely ranked
		for Unilock. Only 2 people actually interviewed for this job, so my self-esteem enjoyed the trip in the gutter.

		<br> 
		
		Indeed, the interview for YUJA, a better version of UWLearn (not exactly but close enough), went very well. I thought I could at least secure a rank.

		At that point, I had more trouble sleeping than 3 weeks ago when the girl I liked coldly walked away from me.

		I realized that we learn more from rejections than lectures and tutorials.
		Students in other universities will never experience this amount of stress and rejection in their first year. I guess that's what separates UW to other universities.

		Nevertheless, I got my match 3 days after on the following Monday. <strong> I am glad to announce that I will be working for Unilock during this summer </strong>

		<br>

		I have also learned about <strong> Jia Jiang </strong>. He inspired me to dig in to my fear of rejection. I would ask people stuff that I would never ask, looking for a rejection.
		I wanted to feel the heart-rate going up so I get used to be more out-going. I guess Rejection Therapy will make you immune to other people's rejection and keep your self-esteem protected
		from what other people's opinions.

		<br>

		Only 3 weeks left before finals hit, I hope I'll survive 1B better the same way I did for 1A. I am glad I got everything sorted out, such as renting my UW apartment and getting a place in Georgetown.

		<br>
		I really want to wish RW the best of luck in her job hunt and don't be creeped out when I smile at you. I know it is over.

  <h2> March 18, 2018 </h2>

   <p>
      Last friday, spent bunch of time during VHDL in the ecelab, almost killed myself over the bugs I had. Glad I could finish yesterday but I ended upkilling my St-Patrick's.
      Ya saw bunch of people partying while I was working on Math119 and ECE124. I at least I get some pleasure finishing the project on time.

    

      <br>

      Overall a lot of stress since finals are coming up, but definitely worth it. This has been my best year so far. I learned so much. Especially how to deal with rejection and failure. 
      <br>
      
      Hopefully I will hear back from Unilock, because my rommates all signed their contract and I still haven't heard from anyone from Unilock so far.

      I really hope the job is not boring since I avoided QA for that reason.
      Anyways I should be grateful that they accepted me, a first year with no experience.

     
   </p>

  <p> Did not go to grading today, definitely not prepared. YuJia said
  he wanted to start his own company by securing the name first. I'm down,
  but I also want to help Weijie or even Jiming and Zhongyu out.
  </p>
  <p> Anyways, Jiu-Jitsu was cancelled today so I went to the gym. My arms
  really hurt right now. I am also very hungry, so I'll grab some food and
  start ECE108 as2 in latex.
  </p>

  <p> wish me luck </p>

  <h2> March 28, 2018 </h2>
  <p> <em> to the github stalker </em> </p>
  <p> just finished editing the lab report, I don't know why RW
  absolutely wants to write the report. It was weird in a sense that she
  didn't want to participate in the lab. This lab was definitely one of 
  the most awkward lab we had so far. Even the lab instructor Frank was giving her a bad time. Oh well! It is over now! 
  </p>

  <p> apart from that, I need to finish Ward's assignment 2 soon so I can get back to studying for finals. I am really behind on 140 assignments and also 124. Hopefully I will catch up by the finals, but I really doubt it.
  </p>

  <p> I have a friday off this week, I can definitely use that to study a little bit more and probably finish off 108. Speaking of 108, we did graph theory in less than 2 hours. Well, Prof Ward's lectures are always <strong> fking entertaining</strong>, even though he argueably can't teach. 
  </p>
  <p> I called in CECA to ask if a contract was necessary for my position and she told me it is not a requirement. It is a bit sketchy but I definitely understand her point of view. Anyways, life in university is really demanding and I wish I could have more free time to do more side projects and thingsthat are not strictly academic.

  <p> <em> to the person maybe finishing 1B </em> </p>

  <p> Today is Easter friday. We have the day off to relax. I really hope I will be productive and finish up 108 as2 since i really don't want to work on it on the weekend
      Anyways, 2 days ago, I asked RW if I could join them on their Niagara trip. I was surprised she didn't say no rightaway. I guess Jia was definitely right. 
    <br>
  We would be very surprised how easy people will accept your request, provided you ask them.</p>
  <p> Anyways, finals in a week of time, I shouldn't care about my grades anymore. Prof Saini was right yesterday when I showed up to his office hours. It is really
  about how much you learn than how high your grades are. Reaching for that #1 spot is useless and you will break yourself doing so

	<h2> April 1st 2018 </h2>
  <p class = "dedicatedTo"> <em> to the person making tons of mistake</em> </p>
  

  <p> So yesterday was a hell of fun writing my 108 assignment in LaTeX. I especially enjoyed the K-map package with all the flying colors.
    <br>
  so I went in to Bilun's room to grab his bowl that he forgot to bring down. That completely triggered him. He was unusually upset for something that could be settled in a more calm manner</p>
  <p>
  I guess it something that he really dislikes, I should be very careful next time and ask for permission 
  </p> 
  <p>
  I am going to get sushi for lunch with all my roommates, Daniel and Tingwei if he decides to wake up at a reasonable time. 
  <br>
  I kind of relaxed this morning, didn't feel like doing any problems and studying for anything.
  <br>
  instead I decided to chill and install another version of linux on my old pc. It felt like Ubuntu 64x was a bit tough and constantly will lag the poor machine
  <br>
  Also, the chinese friends posted bunch of photos of them going to Niagara. Looked like they enjoyed themselves. I am kind of jealous since I stayed home all day doing "work". But a rejection opens the door to other opportunities. I went to Mel's with other ECE friends (shiv Ilya and Kate). It was fun
  </p> 
  <p>
  anyways I also want to know if this distro runs atom better since I could not open Atom on 64 bit Ubuntu.
  <br>
  Finals in exactly 7 1/2 days from now. It is going to be a long week of studying. I'll keep my journal up to date, see you soon.

  <p> I am not math student unfortunately, but I still enjoy the shit out of LaTex. The thing is so powerful it is amazing </p>
  <p> just finished the 108 as1 this morning, will be working on as3 tomorrow </p>
  <p> 1 week left before MATH119, I need to start studying, I won't be doing the lab 4 extra project because I don't have the time for that
  <br>
  other than that, I think I need more practice with 124, but I am super lazy to study because state machines are super long to do. I haven't done a single state reduction on my own and I can't draw a flow chart.
  </p>
  <p> I enjoyed my long week-end, food was really good yesterday. Reddit is correct </p>
  <p> That's it for now, I have Saini's help session to attend this morning. Enough with fidgeting with CSS </p>

  <h2> April 04 2018 </h2>
  <p>
  Just saw my assignment 1 grades, it went decently well, although people such as Daniel and Aditya are still upset...<br>
  First thing that Jason asked was how high is the average...
  <br>
  Why do you give a shit? <br>
  Why? Why am I not upset that I didn't get the 100% I wanted?

  </p>
  <p>
    well, because grades are just numbers, if you think they should reflect on how hard you worked on the assignment, you are only partially correct, only very partially
    <br>
    I think that you should evaluate yourself on how much you learned spending a decent chunk of your time doing this assignment. Personnally, I gained knowledge of VIM, LaTeX and set theory. Everything is a learning opportunity, expecting an external award will make you disappointed. I had a lot of fun learning these new tools and a 87 is very good. 
  <p>
    In psychology, this is the difference between an extrinsic and intrinsic reward. People that think they deserve a 90+ for their work in order for them to justify spending a shit ton of time on an assignment is trying to validate their effort with with an extrinsic reward, grades. Prof Saini is correct,
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> We are here for the knowledge and 
         we are here to learn how to learn </em>
    <br>
    <strong> No one will give a shit about your grades </strong>
    <br>
    don't make your grade define you
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  people in ECE need to change their mentality, that includes myself. Hopefully more and more people will start caring about what they are learning in class and not about the exams that are just there to verify if you have learnt the material.

  <p class = "dedicatedTo"> <em> to knowledge and the person who thinks exams are fun</em> </p>
  <p> <strong> 3 Down, 3 to go </strong> We are getting close to finishing everything and go back and relax in Montreal! </p>
  <p> 4 hours ago, I finished my 140 Final. Just yesterday, I actually bought the textbook. It occured to me that I care enough for the course that I want to read it over the summer. Anyways, it is a required textbook for 240. The next-level circuit next year. Not saying that I will study that hard, but I felt like buying the textbook because I realized how ironic the situation is.</p>
  <p>
  indeed, we had to pay 10K per semester for everything and we can't even pay for a well-written textbook... Prof. Dabbagh is right on the fact that people don't read as much as we used to. We are a lot more on laptops and cell phones. I still find it funny that he is saying that we are living in a microwave. He is right on that since all the cell towers emit high frequency signal that damages our brains and is slowly cooking us.
  </p>
  </p>
  Anyways, I realized also that I am more prompt to commit on my studying if a buy a textbook since I will care about it far more than if I got it off online as a pdf. I actually want to get my money back in terms of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p> Also I realized we only have a week left before we start packing up for Montreal. Time flies so fast here. Really, I feel like I only spent a couple of weeks here in CLV. Hopefully my summer coop will be enjoyable. I don't really care about the pay as long as I enjoy the job and have a good time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Oh well, We'll see what is going to happen with my finals and hopefully I'll get to go to karate tonight. It has been at least 2 months before the last time I showed up. Time is precious here in Waterloo, I feel a lot of people don't care as much.

  <h2> April 15 2018 </h2>
  <p class = "dedicatedTo"> <em>to Prof Ward and Saini</em> </p>
  <p> I am at the end of my before last week in UW. Things are closing off. 3 remaining exams and I am done with 1B ECE. </p>
  <p> After watching videos from Matt from <em>Engineered Truth</em>, Inoticed that people think that university is something mandatory in a successful career. It is good to challenge this thought because we are putting so much value to a college education when 10K per semester could be spent somewhere else. 
  </p>
  <p> I honestly think that it is up to the student to make the most out of his undergrad studies. The degree we get at the end of the 5-3 years of studies is just a certification. The value relies on how much did you learn in these years.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you could buy a degree, or Prof. Saini hands you a bachelor's degree, would you take it? I wouldn't because I don't deserve to be called an ECE graduate. The struggle in these 5 years makes you an ECE graduate. 
  </p>
  <p>
  This brings back the point that you need to struggle to succed. We learn from failures far more than from spoon-fed answers and lectures. 
  <br>
  That is what I think people don't get from Prof Ward. He is not the typical lecturer who will give you all the information and hold your hands in a lecture. <strong> you have to follow his thoughts and keep up with his ideas. </strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
  People seem to be unforgiving when he is not posting the answer to the assignments. They never put themselves in his position. We took 5-6 hours to complete that assignment and he hasn't done the problem himself yet... So as we all are lazy and procrasting, we should understand the reason behind the delay on the solutions.
  <br>
  I'm not saying that this is the correct way to handle assignments and logistics in general nor am I saying that Prof Ward is not to be blamed for his lack of organization for ECE108. 
  </p>
  <p>
  What I do know is that Prof Ward has a teaching style that is slightly different than other profs we ever had. This could be big change for people that didn't have ECE150 with him, butI honestly enjoy his teaching style.
  </p>

  <p> Also Yesterday I was trying to chat with Saini. He is obviously really tired and exhausted in the past days holding help-session. He wasn't really eager to engage in the conversation.
  <br>
  Hopefully I can catch him in a better mood and shape after 106 and have a good chat with him then.
  <br>
  in the meantime, of course I am going to show up to Ward's office hours next week.

    spent 5h in Prof Ward's office yesterday? !?
    <br>
    I think now the majority of ECE can agree that Ward is an amazing person to talk to. Maybe not so good as a prof but everyone has their strength.
  </p>
  <p>
    going to the irish pub with Daniel and Kai was really fun and It really was a good stress relief
    Somehow I was feeling the effect of alcohol after 1 pint which is very unusual. Maybe I haven't had Labatt 50 before so that's why. <br>
    But the honey garlic chicken was pretty good. I think it was a bit too sweet though.
    Anyways I probably should study for ECE108, as I am fairly sure the exam is not going to be as easy as it sounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't know if Saini agreed to my request of taking it just for fun
    Seems so since he sent all of us an email.
    I'll also ask Kennings if he is around campus this week.

It is almost over and I can go back home and relax for few days before starting my coop position in Georgetown.

  <p> Ya Grades came out and I didn't do so well, I worked hard so that is that. My final average will probably mid to high 80s instead of in the 90s.
  I think partially because this semester is a lot harder. We cover materials that are a lot more difficult and that require a lot more work. Getting 90+ is pretty challenging. My exams went all pretty fine so I don't think I under-performed in any of the exams. I am a little bit upset, but I still haven't seen the full picture with 124 and 108 grades not up on learn.
  </p>

  <p> Reflecting back to this semester, it was quite fun and enjoyable. Post-midterm is where I was busy doing bunch of other things and kind of stopped working on assignments. Anyhow, getting good grades was a priority for me and I realized not getting them didn't really affect me that much. Hopefully :)
  </p>
  <p> the biggest feels good moment is that I knew I gave it all so I have no regret that I can think of. If I haven't studied a lot, maybe I would have felt bad.

  <p> staying home is pretty chill, a lot of things to get done such as packing up and fixing up the car. I have also arranged with Weijie tomorrow and Zhuowei today for respectively movies and food.

Why? because it costs money and effort to clean. <br> that is some next level bs when you don't give a shit about your tenant and you only see that $$. <br>
  learn how to be a good landlord DUDE.
  </p>
  <p> and in the meantime, I need to do my best to avoid that leak on his driveway </p>

  <p> biggest bullshit of my life </p>

  <p> bye world, i am fking tired. heading to bed asap </p>

  <p> A week in Unilock now. A good time to give my appreciation of the place </p>
  <p> first of all, this place is loud. If you are not prepared to work in an environment where dust and noise is the biggest factor, don't ever work in a factory </p>
  <p> second, I feel pretty useless and start to wonder why they hired me. It is common perhaps but I haven't done anything productive for the company. Should I take initiative or should I just sit and wait for assignments like I did in school. I am thinking of taking inititative since working on the floor is pretty boring.
  </p>
  <p> lastly, I am grateful I am learning more about "soft skills" such as how to interact with people and how to manage/organize people and stuff Indeed, my direct supervisor is the maintenance supervisor and the person that hired me is the plant manager.
  </p>
  <p> By the way, it was great fun driving to Toronto last Sunday, it was a big challenge for me since I hate Toronto traffic. 4 roads (or lanes) and different exits make driving a lot more difficult around Toronto. My mom was super proud of me and I was pretty surprised myself.

  <p>
  Challenges are good indeed.
